%Calculation of operational costs for aerobic simulations during PHB phase


%The following algorithm is used to calculate the costs with aeration, agitation and
%cooling for the PHB production phase of each two-stage production simulations, under
%aerobic conditions. In order to use this algorithm, first run the desired DFBA 
%simulation in MATLAB. With that, run this algorithm and the aeration, 
%agitation and cooling costs will be calculated.
